AB  - PURPOSE: We assess the effectiveness of multilevel regression with 
      poststratification (MRP) as a tool to mitigate selection bias from online surveys of 
      small geographical regions. METHODS: We collected self-reported health information 
      from an Internet-based sample of adults residing within the St. Louis, MO, 
      metropolitan area in 2017. We created Bayesian hierarchical models with three sets 
      of predictor variables for each of six common health behaviors and outcomes, with 
      results poststratified using the American Community Survey to estimate region and 
      ZIP Code Tabulation Area-level prevalence. RESULTS: When comparing MRP estimates 
      with a population-based sample as a reference, we found that adjustment using MRP 
      can reduce bias in prevalence estimates and provide estimates for local area 
      prevalence. 14 of 18 adjusted estimates were closer to the benchmark than the 
      unadjusted estimates and MRP using all three covariate sets resulted in better 
      overall agreement with the benchmark compared with the unadjusted estimates. 
      CONCLUSIONS: MRP can improve prevalence estimates from self-selected Internet-based 
      samples, although a nonnegligible amount of bias may remain. Illustrating the 
      utility and limitations of this method will help researchers develop relevant 
      estimates of the local public health burden, helping local health officials better 
      understand and reduce poor health outcomes.

AB  - This study examined the variation of student-athletes' identity and motivation 
      across Portuguese and Brazilian universities, accounting for variation in gender, 
      student-athletes' training hours per week, sports level, student-athletes status 
      within each university, and university type. We initially established the validity 
      of the Baller Identity Measurement Scale questionnaire and the Student-Athletes' 
      Motivation toward Sports and Academics Questionnaire-based observations among 441 
      Brazilian and Portuguese student-athletes. Then, the validated version of the 
      questionnaires was applied to a total sample of 765 student-athletes from Brazil (n= 
      568) and Portugal (n = 197). We further considered individual (hours of training and 
      student-athlete status) and contextual characteristics (university type and 
      country). Multilevel regression and poststratification were used to estimate each 
      student-athlete identity and motivation as a function of his or her individual and 
      contextual characteristics. Overall, the predictions showed that cultural (country), 
      academic (type of university), and athletic (training hours) context likely have a 
      substantial influence on student-athletes' identity and motivation.

TI  - Multilevel regression and poststratification as a modeling approach for estimating 
      population quantities in large population health studies: A simulation study.
PG  - 479-491
LID - 10.1002/bimj.201900023 [doi]
AB  - There are now a growing number of applications of multilevel regression and 
      poststratification (MRP) in population health and epidemiological studies. MRP uses 
      multilevel regression to model individual survey responses as a function of 
      demographic and geographic covariates. Estimated mean outcome values for each 
      demographic-geographic respondent subtype are then weighted by the proportions of 
      each subtype in the population to produce an overall population-level estimate. We 
      recently reported an extensive case study of a large nationwide survey and found 
      that MRP performed favorably compared to conventional survey sampling weights for 
      the estimation of population descriptive quantities in a highly selected sample. In 
      this study, we aimed to evaluate, by way of a simulation experiment, both the 
      accuracy and precision of MRP versus survey sampling weights in the context of large 
      population health studies. While much of the research into MRP has been focused on 
      U.S. political and social science, we considered an alternative population structure 
      of smaller size and with notably fewer geographic subsets. We explored the impact on 
      MRP performance of sample size, model misspecification, interactions, and the 
      addition of a geographic-level covariate. MRP was found to achieve generally 
      superior performance in both accuracy and precision at both the national and state 
      levels. Results were generally robust to model misspecification, and MRP performance 
      was further improved by the inclusion of a geographic-level covariate. These 
      findings offer further evidence that MRP provides a promising analytic approach for 
      addressing participation bias in the estimation of population descriptive quantities 
      from large-scale health surveys and cohort studies.

AB  - Multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) is a model-based approach for 
      estimating a population parameter of interest, generally from large-scale surveys. 
      It has been shown to be effective in highly selected samples, which is particularly 
      relevant to investigators of large-scale population health and epidemiologic surveys 
      facing increasing difficulties in recruiting representative samples of participants. 
      We aimed to further examine the accuracy and precision of MRP in a context where 
      census data provided reasonable proxies for true population quantities of interest. 
      We considered 2 outcomes from the baseline wave of the Ten to Men study (Australia, 
      2013-2014) and obtained relevant population data from the 2011 Australian Census. 
      MRP was found to achieve generally superior performance relative to conventional 
      survey weighting methods for the population as a whole and for population subsets of 
      varying sizes. MRP resulted in less variability among estimates across population 
      subsets relative to sample weighting, and there was some evidence of small gains in 
      precision when using MRP, particularly for smaller population subsets. These 
      findings offer further support for MRP as a promising analytical approach for 
      addressing participation bias in the estimation of population descriptive quantities 
      from large-scale health surveys and cohort studies.

      data.
PG  - 412-429
LID - 10.1037/met0000240 [doi]
AB  - The geographic distribution of psychological constructs has long been an area of 
      focus for psychological researchers. Recently, however, there has been increased 
      interest in investigations of the so-called subnational distribution of 
      psychological variables, which focus on localized groupings of individuals within 
      spatial units, such as counties or states. By estimating the subnational 
      distribution of a given outcome (e.g., estimating its state- or county-level means), 
      researchers have been able to address questions about the spatial variation of a 
      variety of psychological constructs and investigate the regional association between 
      psychological phenomena and real-world outcomes, such as health outcomes, prosocial 
      behavior, and racial inequity. Unfortunately, however, there are many challenges to 
      estimating a construct's subnational distribution, such as those raised by response 
      biases and subnational sparsity. To help psychological researchers address these 
      issues, we provide a comprehensive discussion of subnational estimation and 
      introduce multilevel regression and poststratification (MrP), a method that is 
      widely considered to be the gold standard for subnational estimation with random 
      samples. As psychologists often do not have access to large, national random 
      samples, we also report 3 studies evaluating MrP's performance under simulated and 
      real-world conditions of sample biases. Ultimately, we find that MrP is likely to 
      outperform the subnational estimation methods that psychological researchers 
      currently use. Based on this, we suggest that psychologists interested in 
      understanding how psychological phenomena vary below the nation level use MrP to 
      conduct these investigations. To help facilitate this, we have made all code and 
      data used for the reported studies publicly available. (PsycInfo Database Record (c)

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the variation in accumulated basketball 
      training experience, body size, functional performance, deliberate practice 
      motivation, achievement and competitiveness motivation and sources of enjoyment 
      among young female basketball players, partitioning the potential variation by 
      individuals´ biological characteristics (menarche status) and contextual 
      characteristics (competitive age group and competitive level). We considered 114 
      adolescent female basketball players aged 14.3 (1.8) years. We used multilevel 
      regression and poststratification estimations. The adolescent female basketball 
      players selected for state-level had more accumulated experience, were taller and 
      with better functional performance. Conditional on the data, youth female coaches 
      tend to value (probably overvalue) size and function when selecting/promoting 
      players, even at early age groups, likely contributing to an overrepresentation of 
      early maturing girls in at early age groups. Players from club- and state-level were 
      similarly highly motivated for deliberate practice and to achievement. Only for 
      competitiveness, state-level players had higher values than club level players. The 
      sources of enjoyment were influenced by context (competitive levels) for 
      self-referenced competencies and others-referenced competencies. Structured programs 
      of training and competition in youth female basketball provide a nurturing 
      environment for the development of players´ engagement and commitment to training 
      and excellence attainment.

TI  - Multilevel regression and poststratification for estimating population quantities 
      from large health studies: a simulation study based on US population structure.
PG  - 1060-1068
LID - 10.1136/jech-2020-214346 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recruiting a representative sample of participants is becoming 
      increasingly difficult in large-scale health surveys. Multilevel regression and 
      poststratification (MRP) has been shown to be effective in estimating population 
      descriptive quantities in non-representative samples. We performed a simulation 
      study, previously applied to an Australian population, this time to a US population, 
      to assess MRP performance. METHODS: Data were extracted from the 2017 Current 
      Population Survey representing a population of US adult males aged 18-55 years. 
      Simulated datasets of non-representative samples were generated. State-level 
      prevalence estimates for a dichotomous outcome using MRP were compared with the use 
      of sampling weights (with and without raking adjustment). We also investigated the 
      impact on MRP performance of sample size, model misspecification, interactions and 
      the addition of a geographic-level covariate. RESULTS: MRP was found to achieve 
      generally superior performance, with large gains in precision vastly outweighing the 
      increased accuracy observed for sampling weights with raking adjustment. MRP 
      estimates were generally robust to model misspecification. We found a tendency of 
      MRP to over-pool between-state variation in the outcome, particularly for the least 
      populous states and small sample sizes. The inclusion of a state-level covariate 
      appeared to mitigate this and further improve MRP performance. DISCUSSION: MRP has 
      been shown to be effective in estimating population descriptive quantities in two 
      different populations. This provides promising evidence for the general 
      applicability of MRP to populations with different geographic structures. MRP 
      appears to be a valuable analytic strategy for addressing potential participation 
      bias from large-scale health surveys.

TI  - Geographic Distributions of Extreme Weather Risk Perceptions in the United States.
PG  - 2498-2508
LID - 10.1111/risa.13569 [doi]
AB  - Weather and climate disasters pose an increasing risk to life and property in the 
      United States. Managing this risk requires objective information about the nature of 
      the threat and subjective information about how people perceive it. Meteorologists 
      and climatologists have a relatively firm grasp of the historical objective risk. 
      For example, we know which parts of the United States are most likely to experience 
      drought, heat waves, flooding, snow or ice storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes. We 
      know less about the geographic distribution of the perceived risks of meteorological 
      events and trends. Do subjective perceptions align with exposure to weather risks? 
      This question is difficult to answer because analysts have yet to develop a 
      comprehensive and spatially consistent methodology for measuring risk perceptions 
      across geographic areas in the United States. In this project, we propose a 
      methodology that uses multilevel regression and poststratification to estimate 
      extreme weather and climate risk perceptions by geographic area (i.e., region, 
      state, forecast area, and county). Then we apply the methodology using data from 
      three national surveys (n = 9,542). This enables us to measure, map, and compare 
      perceptions of risk from multiple weather hazards in geographic areas across the 
      country.

      system.
PG  - 127-37

AB  - Small area estimation is a statistical technique used to produce reliable estimates 
      for smaller geographic areas than those for which the original surveys were 
      designed. Such small area estimates (SAEs) often lack rigorous external validation. 
      In this study, we validated our multilevel regression and poststratification SAEs 
      from 2011 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data using direct estimates 
      from 2011 Missouri County-Level Study and American Community Survey data at both the 
      state and county levels. Coefficients for correlation between model-based SAEs and 
      Missouri County-Level Study direct estimates for 115 counties in Missouri were all 
      significantly positive (0.28 for obesity and no health-care coverage, 0.40 for 
      current smoking, 0.51 for diabetes, and 0.69 for chronic obstructive pulmonary 
      disease). Coefficients for correlation between model-based SAEs and American 
      Community Survey direct estimates of no health-care coverage were 0.85 at the county 
      level (811 counties) and 0.95 at the state level. Unweighted and weighted 
      model-based SAEs were compared with direct estimates; unweighted models performed 
      better. External validation results suggest that multilevel regression and 
      poststratification model-based SAEs using single-year Behavioral Risk Factor 
      Surveillance System data are valid and could be used to characterize geographic 
      variations in health indictors at local levels (such as counties) when high-quality 
      local survey data are not available.

AB  - Investigators in large-scale population health studies face increasing difficulties 
      in recruiting representative samples of participants. Nonparticipation, item 
      nonresponse, and attrition, when follow-up is involved, often result in highly 
      selected samples even in well-designed studies. We aimed to assess the potential 
      value of multilevel regression and poststratification, a method previously used to 
      successfully forecast US presidential election results, for addressing biases due to 
      nonparticipation in the estimation of population descriptive quantities in large 
      cohort studies. The investigation was performed as an extensive case study using 
      baseline data (2013-2014) from a large national health survey of Australian males 
      (Ten to Men: The Australian Longitudinal Study on Male Health). Analyses were 
      performed in the open-source Bayesian computational package RStan. Results showed 
      greater consistency and precision across population subsets of varying sizes when 
      compared with estimates obtained using conventional survey sampling weights. 
      Estimates for smaller population subsets exhibited a greater degree of shrinkage 
      towards the national estimate. Multilevel regression and poststratification provides 
      a promising analytical approach to addressing potential participation bias in the 
      estimation of population descriptive quantities from large-scale health surveys and 
      cohort studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore health literacy as a marker of voter confusion in order to 
      understand the basis for public opposition to community water fluoridation. DESIGN: 
      A cross-sectional study. SETTING: Conducted in three large US cities of San Antonio, 
      Texas (602 voting precincts); Wichita, Kansas (171 voting precincts); and Portland, 
      Oregon (132 voting precincts). Precinct-level voting data were compiled from 
      community water fluoridation referendums conducted in San Antonio in 2002, Wichita 
      in 2012 and Portland in 2013. PARTICIPANTS: Voter turnout expressed as a percentage 
      of registered voters was 38% in San Antonio (n=2 92 811), 47% in Wichita (n=129 199) 
      and 38% in Portland (n=164 301). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The dependent variable was 
      the percentage of votes in favour of fluoridating drinking water. Precinct-level 
      voting data were mapped to precinct scores of health literacy, and to US Census and 
      American Community Survey characteristics of race/ethnicity, age, income and 
      educational attainment. Multilevel regression with post-stratification predicted the 
      precinct mean health literacy scores, with weights generated from the National 
      Association of Adult Literacy health literacy survey, with item response theory 
      computed scoring for health literacy. Predictive models on voter support of 
      community water fluoridation were compared using robust linear regression to 
      determine how precinct-level characteristics influenced voter support in order to 
      determine whether health literacy explained more variance in voting preference than 
      sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: Precinct-level health literacy was 
      positively associated with voter turnout, although sociodemographic characteristics 
      were better predictors of turnout. Approximately 60% of voters opposed community 
      water fluoridation in Wichita and Portland, whereas in San Antonio, a small majority 
      (53%) voted in favour of it. Models suggest that a one SD increase in health 
      literacy scores predicted a 12 percentage point increase support for community water 
      fluoridation. CONCLUSION: Educational attainment and health literacy are modifiable 
      characteristics associated with voting precincts' support for community water 
      fluoridation.

TI  - Multilevel regression and poststratification for small-area estimation of population 
      health outcomes: a case study of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease prevalence 
      using the behavioral risk factor surveillance system.
PG  - 1025-33
LID - 10.1093/aje/kwu018 [doi]
AB  - A variety of small-area statistical models have been developed for health surveys, 
      but none are sufficiently flexible to generate small-area estimates (SAEs) to meet 
      data needs at different geographic levels. We developed a multilevel logistic model 
      with both state- and nested county-level random effects for chronic obstructive 
      pulmonary disease (COPD) using 2011 data from the Behavioral Risk Factor 
      Surveillance System. We applied poststratification with the (decennial) US Census 
      2010 counts of census-block population to generate census-block-level SAEs of COPD 
      prevalence which could be conveniently aggregated to all other census geographic 
      units, such as census tracts, counties, and congressional districts. The model-based 
      SAEs and direct survey estimates of COPD prevalence were quite consistent at both 
      the county and state levels. The Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.99 at the 
      state level and ranged from 0.88 to 0.95 at the county level. Our extended 
      multilevel regression modeling and poststratification approach could be adapted for 
      other geocoded national health surveys to generate reliable SAEs for population 
      health outcomes at all administrative and legislative geographic levels of interest 
      in a scalable framework.

TI  - Ecological social capital does not predict geographical variance in increases in 
      depression following the 2008 financial crisis.
PG  - 163-179
LID - 10.1111/bjop.12448 [doi]
AB  - Research suggests that the financial crisis of 2008 and its aftermath were 
      associated with an increase in mental health problems, but there has been little 
      research into potential protective factors. Ecological social capital is a plausible 
      candidate given evidence of its protective status following natural disasters. 
      Pre-crisis area-level estimates of generalized trust and sense of belonging were 
      computed from the 2004 to 2006 waves of the Living in Wales survey (N = 43,473) for 
      413 neighbourhoods in Wales, using multilevel regression with post-stratification, a 
      technique for disaggregating survey data into small area estimates. Area estimates 
      and the planned analysis were preregistered using Open Science Framework. Data 
      (N = 180,462) from the Welsh Health Survey (2003-2015) were then used to model 
      whether social capital was protective against depression in general and whether it 
      moderated the increase in depression prevalence, associated with the financial 
      crisis. Depression rates increased post-crisis (odds ratio [OR] = 1.271), and trust 
      was a protective factor against depression (OR = 0.775). The hypothesized 
      interaction, however, was not significant (OR = 1.033), nor was sense of belonging 
      (OR = 0.934) or its interaction with the crisis (OR = 1.024). Although ecological 
      generalized trust appears to be a protective factor against depression, it did not 
      buffer against the mental health impact of the financial crisis.

TI  - Use of Small-Area Estimates to Describe County-Level Geographic Variation in 
      Prevalence of Extreme Obesity Among US Adults.
PG  - e204289
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.4289 [doi]
LID - e204289
AB  - IMPORTANCE: The prevalence of extreme obesity continues to increase among adults in 
      the US, yet there is an absence of subnational estimates and geographic description 
      of extreme obesity. This shortcoming prevents a thorough understanding of the 
      geographic distribution of extreme obesity, which in turn limits the ability of 
      public health agencies and policy makers to target areas with a known higher 
      prevalence. OBJECTIVES: To use small-area estimation to create county-level 
      estimates of extreme obesity in the US and apply spatial methods to identify 
      clusters of high and low prevalence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A 
      cross-sectional analysis was conducted using multilevel regression and 
      poststratification with data from the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance 
      System and the US Census Bureau to create prevalence estimates of county-level 
      extreme obesity (body mass index ≥40 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by 
      height in meters squared]). Data were included on adults (aged ≥18 years) living in 
      the contiguous US. Analysis was performed from June 4 to December 28, 2018. MAIN 
      OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Multilevel logistic regression models estimated the 
      probability of extreme obesity based on individual-level and area-level 
      characteristics. Census counts were multiplied by these probabilities and summed by 
      county to create county-level prevalence estimates. Moran index values were 
      calculated to assess spatial autocorrelation and identify spatial clusters of hot 
      and cold spots. Estimates of moderate obesity were obtained for comparison. RESULTS: 
      Overall, the weighted prevalence of extreme obesity was 4.0% (95% CI, 3.9%-4.1%) and 
      the prevalence of moderate obesity was 23.7% (95% CI, 23.4%-23.9%). County-level 
      prevalence of extreme obesity ranged from 1.3% (95% CI, 1.3%-1.3%) to 15.7% (95% CI, 
      15.3%-16.0%). The Pearson correlation coefficient comparing model-predicted 
      estimates with direct estimates was 0.81 (P < .001). The Moran index I score was 
      0.35 (P < .001), indicating spatial clustering. Significant clusters of high and low 
      prevalence were identified. Hot spots indicating clustering of high prevalence of 
      extreme obesity in several regions, including the Mississippi Delta region and the 
      Southeast, were identified, as well as clusters of low prevalence in the Rocky 
      Mountain region and the Northeast. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Substantial geographic 
      variation was identified in the prevalence of extreme obesity; there was 
      considerable county-level variation even in states generally known as having high or 
      low prevalence of obesity. The results suggest that extreme obesity prevalence 
      demonstrates spatial dependence and clustering and may support the need for substate 
      analysis and benefit of disaggregation of obesity by group. Findings from this study 
      can inform local and national policies seeking to identify populations most at risk 
      from very high body mass index.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Decisions about the continued need for control measures to contain the 
      spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rely on 
      accurate and up-to-date information about the number of people testing positive for 
      SARS-CoV-2 and risk factors for testing positive. Existing surveillance systems are 
      generally not based on population samples and are not longitudinal in design. 
      METHODS: Samples were collected from individuals aged 2 years and older living in 
      private households in England that were randomly selected from address lists and 
      previous Office for National Statistics surveys in repeated cross-sectional 
      household surveys with additional serial sampling and longitudinal follow-up. 
      Participants completed a questionnaire and did nose and throat self-swabs. The 
      percentage of individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was estimated over 
      time by use of dynamic multilevel regression and poststratification, to account for 
      potential residual non-representativeness. Potential changes in risk factors for 
      testing positive over time were also assessed. The study is registered with the 
      ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN21086382. FINDINGS: Between April 26 and Nov 1, 2020, results 
      were available from 1 191 170 samples from 280 327 individuals; 5231 samples were 
      positive overall, from 3923 individuals. The percentage of people testing positive 
      for SARS-CoV-2 changed substantially over time, with an initial decrease between 
      April 26 and June 28, 2020, from 0·40% (95% credible interval 0·29-0·54) to 0·06% 
      (0·04-0·07), followed by low levels during July and August, 2020, before substantial 
      increases at the end of August, 2020, with percentages testing positive above 1% 
      from the end of October, 2020. Having a patient-facing role and working outside your 
      home were important risk factors for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the end of 
      the first wave (April 26 to June 28, 2020), but not in the second wave (from the end 
      of August to Nov 1, 2020). Age (young adults, particularly those aged 17-24 years) 
      was an important initial driver of increased positivity rates in the second wave. 
      For example, the estimated percentage of individuals testing positive was more than 
      six times higher in those aged 17-24 years than in those aged 70 years or older at 
      the end of September, 2020. A substantial proportion of infections were in 
      individuals not reporting symptoms around their positive test (45-68%, dependent on 
      calendar time. INTERPRETATION: Important risk factors for testing positive for 
      SARS-CoV-2 varied substantially between the part of the first wave that was captured 
      by the study (April to June, 2020) and the first part of the second wave of 
      increased positivity rates (end of August to Nov 1, 2020), and a substantial 
      proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms, indicating that 
      continued monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 in the community will be important for managing 
      the COVID-19 pandemic moving forwards. FUNDING: Department of Health and Social

AB  - Reducing health inequalities requires improved understanding of the causes of 
      variation. Local-level variation reflects differences in local population 
      characteristics and health system performance. Identifying low- and high-performing 
      localities allows investigation into these differences. We used Multilevel 
      Regression with Post-stratification (MRP) to synthesise data from multiple sources, 
      using chlamydia testing as our example. We used national probability survey data to 
      identify individual-level characteristics associated with chlamydia testing and 
      combined this with local-level census data to calculate expected levels of testing 
      in each local authority (LA) in England, allowing us to identify LAs where observed 
      chlamydia testing rates were lower or higher than expected, given population 
      characteristics. Taking account of multiple covariates, including age, sex, 
      ethnicity, student and cohabiting status, 5.4% and 3.5% of LAs had testing rates 
      higher than expected for 95% and 99% posterior credible intervals, respectively; 
      60.9% and 50.8% had rates lower than expected. Residual differences between observed 
      and MRP expected values were smallest for LAs with large proportions of non-white 
      ethnic populations. London boroughs that were markedly different from expected MRP 
      values (≥90% posterior exceedance probability) had actively targeted risk groups. 
      This type of synthesis allows more refined inferences to be made at small-area 
      levels than previously feasible.

AB  - OpenStreetMap, a crowdsourced geographic database, provides the only global-level, 
      openly licensed source of geospatial road data, and the only national-level source 
      in many countries. However, researchers, policy makers, and citizens who want to 
      make use of OpenStreetMap (OSM) have little information about whether it can be 
      relied upon in a particular geographic setting. In this paper, we use two 
      complementary, independent methods to assess the completeness of OSM road data in 
      each country in the world. First, we undertake a visual assessment of OSM data 
      against satellite imagery, which provides the input for estimates based on a 
      multilevel regression and poststratification model. Second, we fit sigmoid curves to 
      the cumulative length of contributions, and use them to estimate the saturation 
      level for each country. Both techniques may have more general use for assessing the 
      development and saturation of crowd-sourced data. Our results show that in many 
      places, researchers and policymakers can rely on the completeness of OSM, or will 
      soon be able to do so. We find (i) that globally, OSM is ∼83% complete, and more 
      than 40% of countries-including several in the developing world-have a fully mapped 
      street network; (ii) that well-governed countries with good Internet access tend to 
      be more complete, and that completeness has a U-shaped relationship with population 
      density-both sparsely populated areas and dense cities are the best mapped; and 
      (iii) that existing global datasets used by the World Bank undercount roads by more 
      than 30%.

AB  - Although ecological cognitive social capital is an important predictor of mental 
      health, measurement remains crude. Multi-level regression with post-stratification 
      (MRP) is a technique for computing small area estimates of survey responses, used in 
      political science but hitherto not for estimating ecological protective factors in 
      epidemiology. National Survey for Wales 2016-17 data (N = 10,486) were used to 
      produce MRP estimates of belonging and generalised trust for 410 middle super output 
      areas covering Wales. These estimates were used to predict psychiatric admission 
      rates in 2017 (N = 9978 cases). Low belonging and trust are ecological risk factors 
      for psychiatric admissions, with a 29% (25-33%) and 25% (22-29%) increase in 
      admissions per standard deviation decrease respectively. Equivalent results for 
      using standard simple aggregation of survey data by area suggest 8% (4-12%) and 10% 
      (6-14%) increases in risk per standard deviation. MRP has potential for studying 
      ecological risk factors based on self-report measures, with greater predictive 
      validity for incidence of psychiatric admissions than current methods.

      poststratification to generalize findings beyond the observed sample.
LID - 10.1037/met0000362 [doi]
AB  - Psychology research often focuses on interactions, and this has deep implications 
      for inference from nonrepresentative samples. For the goal of estimating average 
      treatment effects, we propose to fit a model allowing treatment to interact with 
      background variables and then average over the distribution of these variables in 
      the population. This can be seen as an extension of multilevel regression and 
      poststratification (MRP), a method used in political science and other areas of 
      survey research, where researchers wish to generalize from a sparse and possibly 
      nonrepresentative sample to the general population. In this article, we discuss 
      areas where this method can be used in the psychological sciences. We use our method 
      to estimate the norming distribution for the Big Five Personality Scale using open 
      source data. We argue that large open data sources like this and other collaborative 
      data sources can potentially be combined with MRP to help resolve current challenges 
      of generalizability and replication in psychology. (PsycInfo Database Record (c)

AB  - BACKGROUND: We used a multilevel regression and poststratification approach to 
      generate estimates of health-related outcomes using Behavioral Risk Factor 
      Surveillance System 2013 (BRFSS) data for the 500 US cities. We conducted an 
      empirical study to investigate whether the approach is robust using different health 
      surveys. METHODS: We constructed a multilevel logistic model with individual-level 
      age, sex, and race/ethnicity as predictors (Model I), and sequentially added 
      educational attainment (Model II) and area-level poverty (Model III) for 5 
      health-related outcomes using the nationwide BRFSS, the Massachusetts BRFSS 2013 (a 
      state subset of nationwide BRFSS), and the Boston BRFSS 2010/2013 (an independent 
      survey), respectively. We applied each model to the Boston population (2010 Census) 
      to predict each outcome in Boston and compared each with corresponding Boston BRFSS 
      direct estimates. RESULTS: Using Model I for the nationwide BRFSS, estimates of 
      diabetes, high blood pressure, physical inactivity, and binge drinking fell within 
      the 95% confidence interval of corresponding Boston BRFSS direct estimates. Adding 
      educational attainment and county-level poverty (Models II and III) further improved 
      their accuracy, particularly for current smoking (the model-based estimate was 15.2% 
      by Model I and 18.1% by Model II). The estimates based on state BRFSS and Boston 
      BRFSS models were similar to those based on the nationwide BRFSS, but area-level 
      poverty did not improve the estimates significantly. CONCLUSION: The estimates of 
      health-related outcomes were similar using different health surveys. Model 
      specification could vary by surveys with different geographic coverage.

TI  - Association between variables used in the field substitution and post-stratification 
      adjustment in the Belgian health interview survey and non-response.
PG  - 197-206

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Field substitution and post-stratification adjustment have been proposed 
      to reduce non-response bias in population surveys. We investigated if variables 
      involved in those techniques in the Belgian health interview survey 2004 are 
      associated with non-response and assessed the impact of field substitution and 
      post-stratification adjustment on the survey results. METHODS: Data were obtained 
      from all selected households (n = 12.204). The association between non-response and 
      the selected variables was explored through multilevel logistic regression models 
      with municipality and statistical sector as random effects. RESULTS: All 
      investigated variables were significantly related with non-response. Especially 
      households that could not be contacted differed substantially from those who 
      participated. Only post-stratification had a clear impact on the survey results. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Even if variables used in the field substitution procedure of health 
      surveys are strongly associated with non-response, the impact of field substitution 
      on the survey results may be minimal, either because there was no bias of relevance 
      or it was not captured. The usefulness of field substitution to correct for 
      non-response bias in population health surveys seems to be quite limited.

TI  - Predicting Periodontitis at State and Local Levels in the United States.
PG  - 515-22
LID - 10.1177/0022034516629112 [doi]
AB  - The objective of the study was to estimate the prevalence of periodontitis at state 
      and local levels across the United States by using a novel, small area estimation 
      (SAE) method. Extended multilevel regression and poststratification analyses were 
      used to estimate the prevalence of periodontitis among adults aged 30 to 79 y at 
      state, county, congressional district, and census tract levels by using periodontal 
      data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2009-2012, 
      population counts from the 2010 US census, and smoking status estimates from the 
      Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System in 2012. The SAE method used age, race, 
      gender, smoking, and poverty variables to estimate the prevalence of periodontitis 
      as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/American Academy of 
      Periodontology case definitions at the census block levels and aggregated to larger 
      administrative and geographic areas of interest. Model-based SAEs were validated 
      against national estimates directly from NHANES 2009-2012. Estimated prevalence of 
      periodontitis ranged from 37.7% in Utah to 52.8% in New Mexico among the states 
      (mean, 45.1%; median, 44.9%) and from 33.7% to 68% among counties (mean, 46.6%; 
      median, 45.9%). Severe periodontitis ranged from 7.27% in New Hampshire to 10.26% in 
      Louisiana among the states (mean, 8.9%; median, 8.8%) and from 5.2% to 17.9% among 
      counties (mean, 9.2%; median, 8.8%). Overall, the predicted prevalence of 
      periodontitis was highest for southeastern and southwestern states and for 
      geographic areas in the Southeast along the Mississippi Delta, as well as along the 
      US and Mexico border. Aggregated model-based SAEs were consistent with national 
      prevalence estimates from NHANES 2009-2012. This study is the first-ever estimation 
      of periodontitis prevalence at state and local levels in the United States, and this 
      modeling approach complements public health surveillance efforts to identify areas 
      with a high burden of periodontitis.

AB  - Because conducting population-based oral health screening is resource intensive, 
      oral health data at small-area levels (e.g., county-level) are not commonly 
      available. We applied the multilevel logistic regression and poststratification 
      method to estimate county-level prevalence of untreated dental caries among children 
      aged 6-9years in the United States using data from the National Health and Nutrition 
      Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2010 linked with various area-level data at census 
      tract, county and state levels. We validated model-based national estimates against 
      direct estimates from NHANES. We also compared model-based estimates with direct 
      estimates from select State Oral Health Surveys (SOHS) at state and county levels. 
      The model with individual-level covariates only and the model with individual-, 
      census tract- and county-level covariates explained 7.2% and 96.3% respectively of 
      overall county-level variation in untreated caries. Model-based county-level 
      prevalence estimates ranged from 4.9% to 65.2% with median of 22.1%. The model-based 
      national estimate (19.9%) matched the NHANES direct estimate (19.8%). We found 
      significantly positive correlations between model-based estimates for 8-year-olds 
      and direct estimates from the third-grade State Oral Health Surveys (SOHS) at state 
      level for 34 states (Pearson coefficient: 0.54, P=0.001) and SOHS estimates at 
      county level for 53 New York counties (Pearson coefficient: 0.38, P=0.006). This 
      methodology could be a useful tool to characterize county-level disparities in 
      untreated dental caries among children aged 6-9years and complement oral health 
      surveillance to inform public health programs especially when local-level data are 
      not available although the lack of external validation due to data unavailability 
      should be acknowledged.

LID - e0159774
AB  - While climate scientists have developed high resolution data sets on the 
      distribution of climate risks, we still lack comparable data on the local 
      distribution of public climate change opinions. This paper provides the first effort 
      to estimate local climate and energy opinion variability outside the United States. 
      Using a multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP) approach, we estimate 
      opinion in federal electoral districts and provinces. We demonstrate that a majority 
      of the Canadian public consistently believes that climate change is happening. 
      Belief in climate change's causes varies geographically, with more people 
      attributing it to human activity in urban as opposed to rural areas. Most 
      prominently, we find majority support for carbon cap and trade policy in every 
      province and district. By contrast, support for carbon taxation is more 
      heterogeneous. Compared to the distribution of US climate opinions, Canadians 
      believe climate change is happening at higher levels. This new opinion data set will 
      support climate policy analysis and climate policy decision making at national, 
      provincial and local levels.
