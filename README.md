# MRP diagnostic visualisation

## Meeting Notes 30 April, 2021

An interesting paper on weights with mulitlevel models - https://notstatschat.rbind.io/2019/01/18/another-way-to-see-why-mixed-models-in-survey-data-are-hard/

This meeting we:
Reviewed papers that were not agreed upon

- Dewi is going to add papers with search term "hierarchical model*"
- AIMS: Finish reviewing abstracts! :)

## Meeting Notes 23 April 2021

After removing duplicates, we have 222 papers. Visual inspection shows good coverage of well-known papers

Using the diagnostic criteria from 16 April with some randomly selected samples, it appears it will not exclude anything important so we will go ahead. 
Synced libraries

Next steps:

1. Read through abstract with diagnostic criteria  
2. Invite Shiro to repo
3. Aim for 30 abstracts

## Meeeting Notes 16 April 2021

1. Doing additional source on the data bases to be ["multilevel regression" AND "post-stratification"] OR ["multilevel model" AND "post-stratification"]
2. Remove the duplicates papers.
3. List of criteria for the abstract:
   - Mentions analysis of data 
     OR
   - Creation of simulation data
     AND
   - Mentions use of MRP OR multilevel models to make population estimates.
   - Mentions use of other regression models (BART, Spatial, Stacked, trees) to make population estimates
4. What figures ar eligible for our study?
5. Make GitHub repo and share EndNote library to Lauren (Good way to store the data and organize meeting notes.)
