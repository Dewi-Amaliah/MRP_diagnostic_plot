# Meeting Notes 7th May 2021

Reviewed exclusion disagreements

Reviewed inclusion disagreements

To dos:

Go through inclusion mismatch from lewis to tausonovitch (make notes in word doc)
Create final incluson/exclusion list and check numbers
Next steps:

Set a csv with column for paper details, column for a link the image, and image metadata
Think about inclusion and data to collect (make a list)
Conditions for inclusion on our study?
What data do we want to collect?
Check against a few papers
Meeting Notes 30 April, 2021

An interesting paper on weights with mulitlevel models - https://notstatschat.rbind.io/2019/01/18/another-way-to-see-why-mixed-models-in-survey-data-are-hard/

# This meeting we: Reviewed papers that were not agreed upon

Dewi is going to add papers with search term "hierarchical model*"
AIMS: Finish reviewing abstracts! :)
Meeting Notes 23 April 2021

After removing duplicates, we have 222 papers. Visual inspection shows good coverage of well-known papers

Using the diagnostic criteria from 16 April with some randomly selected samples, it appears it will not exclude anything important so we will go ahead. Synced libraries

Next steps:

Read through abstract with diagnostic criteria
Invite Shiro to repo
Aim for 30 abstracts

# Meeeting Notes 16 April 2021

Doing additional source on the data bases to be ["multilevel regression" AND "post-stratification"] OR ["multilevel model" AND "post-stratification"]
Remove the duplicates papers.
List of criteria for the abstract:
Mentions analysis of data OR
Creation of simulation data AND
Mentions use of MRP OR multilevel models to make population estimates.
Mentions use of other regression models (BART, Spatial, Stacked, trees) to make population estimates
What figures ar eligible for our study?
Make GitHub repo and share EndNote library to Lauren (Good way to store the data and organize meeting notes.)
