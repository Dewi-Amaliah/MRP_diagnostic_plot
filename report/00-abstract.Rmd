# Abstract {-}

Surveys provide important evidence for policy making, decision making and understanding society. However, conducting the large surveys required to provide subpopulation level estimates is expensive and time-consuming. Multilevel Regression and Poststratification (MRP) is a promising method to provide reliable estimates for subpopulations from surveys without the amount of data needed for reliable direct estimates. Graphical displays have been widely used to communicate and diagnose MRP estimates. However, there have been few studies on how visualisation should be performed in this field. Accordingly, this study examines the current practice of MRP visualisation using a systematic literature review. This study also applies MRP to estimate the Trump vote share in the U.S. 2016 presidential election using the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) data to illustrate the implication of current visualisation practices and explore alternatives for improvement. We find that uncertainty is not often displayed in the current practice, despite its importance for survey inference. The choropleth map is the most frequently used to display MRP estimates even though it only shows point estimates and could hinder the information conveyed. Using various graphical representations, we show that visualisation with uncertainty can illustrate the effect of different model specifications on the estimation result. In addition, this study also proposes a visualisation strategy to also take the bias-variance trade-off into account when evaluating MRP models.
