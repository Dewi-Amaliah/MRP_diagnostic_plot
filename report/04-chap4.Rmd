# Conclusion {#ch:conclusion}

Graphics is essential to convey statistical information, and it has been widely used to communicate and diagnose MRP models. However, there have been few studies discussing it. Therefore, in this study, we conduct a systematic literature review to review the current practice in MRP visualisation. In addition, we perform a case study using CCES data to demonstrate the implication of current visualisation practices and explore the alternatives and possible improvements. 

We find that the choropleth map is the most frequently used visualisation to communicate MRP estimates. However, it is problematic as it often hinders the information in small geographic areas and does not consider the uncertainty of estimates. Instead, we explore alternatives to display state-wise estimates using a dot plot with an error bar. Regarding uncertainty, even though it is important to show estimates variability, few plots display uncertainty in practice. We offer some alternatives to display it, for example, using a violin plot. This study also demonstrates how graphs have aided us in understanding how estimation method and model choices affect the estimates. We also use the credible interval length to illustrate the bias-variance trade-off. 

In a broader context, this study has provided empirical evidence on how visualisation has been performed in MRP studies. These findings could be a benchmark to explore more alternatives improvements of visualisation choices that are not covered in this study. We realize that the MRP model we have shown might not be the best fit in terms of its accuracy. Hence it could have been improved by setting another model specification. Also, this study only explores alternatives to MRP visualisation. Future work should employ careful experimentation. These future studies will provide evidence as to whether these alternatives can communicate more effectively and enhance interpretability.
