# Background and Motivation


- Surveys are important.

- Multilevel regression and poststratification could provide reliable estimates of subpopulations.

- Graphical display is widely used to communicate and diagnose MRP estimates. 

- Makela, Si, and Gelman (2017) and Schneider and Jacoby (2017) study the visualisation of polling data and public opinion research.

# Study Objectives 


Perform **Systematic Literature Review** to:

- Understand the current practice of visualisation of MRP models.

and **Case Study** to:

- Understand the implication of existing visualisation choices with real-world data. 

- Explore possible improvement of the current practice of MRP visualisation.

# Systematic Literature Review

.pull-left[

- Identification of relevant literature, i.e., articles using MRP as its method and should display at least one MRP visualtisation. 

- Database used to identify literatures: JSTOR, EBSCO, and PubMed. 

- Done in two stages: abstract and full manuscript review.

- 71 articles are relevant; extracted 243 plots.

## Case Study

### Aim

Applies MRP in estimating the Trump's vote share in the U.S. 2016 Presidential Election.

### Data 

- Survey data: Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) 2016. 

- Population data: American Community Survey (2015-2017)

### Visualising MRP 



- **Communication-purpose visualisation**
- **Metrics visualisation**
- **Comparison-purpose**

  - Comparison of estimation methods (raw, weighted, and MRP estimates)
  - Comparison of model specifications:
    
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)
tribble(~Model, ~Response, ~Predictors,
        "Baseline", "vote", "age, gender, state, collapsed_race",
        "Model 2", "vote", "age, gender, state, collapsed_race, education",
        "Model 3", "vote", "age, gender, state, original_race",
        "Model 4a", "intent", "age, gender, state, collapsed_race, education",
        "Model 4b", "party id", "age, gender, state, collapsed_race, education") %>%
  kable(caption = "Model specifications in the case study") %>%
  kable_styling()
```

# Conclusion

- This study has shown us the current practice in MRP visualisation. 

- Uncertainty is often not taken into account when visualising MRP, hence we offer some alternatives to display it. 

- **Future work** is needed with careful experimentation to provide the evidence whether these alternatives can communicate MRP models more effectively and enhance interpretability.

- Choropleth can hinder the information of small area with small polygon.

- Only displays point estimates.

- Often hard to interpret.
