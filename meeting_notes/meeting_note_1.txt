Meeting Note #1 
Date: 9 April 2021


Dewi read and learn this paper: 
https://www.mathematica.org/our-publications-and-findings/publications/multilevel-regression-with-poststratification-for-the-analysis-of-sms-survey-data


Shiro's suggestion of what a paper on this would look like (different topic)


https://www.princeton.edu/~davidlee/wp/RDDEconomics.pdf


My suggestion (different topic)


https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.01449.pdf


Next steps:


Call a friend/maybe collaborate
- Contact Shiro Kuriwaki & have a chat
- Contact Jonathan Gellar & he suggests


Research steps:
1. Collecting up influential MRP papers (systematic review)
2. Quickly skim to make they're useful/meet our criteria:
- They need to use MRP
- They need have figures that show their results
- Those figures need be used in a diagnostic fashion 
-> Comparisons between different methods
-> Benchmarking type plots
-> Comparisons to ground truth
- Database of the eligible papers
- Database of eligible plots and summaries 
- Synthesize it. 


Potential extensions:
- Code them all in ggplot 
- Make for the different types for the package
- Fill any gaps (develop new plots)


Rough timeline
April - November (7 months)


Next stages: 
1. LK sends emails to shiro and jonathan
2. Dewi does a few database searches (save the terms, numbers) (counts)
 - Download endnote (counts)
 - Remove duplicates (counts)
